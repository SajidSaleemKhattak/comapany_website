    question: "How does the design process work?",
    answer:
      "Our design process is simple and efficient. First, you provide us with your design requirements and specifications. Our talented creatives then submit their designs based on your brief. Once the designs are ready, we present them to you for review. You have the opportunity to provide feedback, request revisions, and refine the concepts until you are completely satisfied with the final design.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I provide feedback and make revisions to the designs?",
    answer:
      "Yes! We encourage feedback and offer revisions to ensure the final design meets your expectations. Once you receive the initial design drafts, you can review them and share your thoughts. Whether it's minor tweaks or major changes, our team will work with you to refine the design. Our goal is to deliver a final product that aligns perfectly with your vision and business needs.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to receive the design submissions?",
    answer:
      "The turnaround time depends on the project, but typically, initial submissions are delivered within a few days. More complex projects may take a bit longer, as we ensure each design is carefully crafted to meet your requirements. We prioritize efficiency while maintaining high-quality standards. If you have urgent requests, let us know, and we will do our best to accommodate your timeline.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I donâ€™t like any of the submitted designs?",
    answer:
      "No worries! We can refine the designs based on your feedback or offer additional concepts to better match your vision. Our designers are committed to ensuring your satisfaction, and we provide multiple revision rounds to get the design just right. If needed, we can explore alternative styles, colors, and layouts to better suit your preferences.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are the designs I receive exclusive to me?",
    answer:
      "Yes, all final approved designs are exclusive to you and will not be shared or reused. We respect the uniqueness of every project and ensure that the work delivered remains yours. Our designers create custom-tailored solutions that are aligned with your brand identity, so you can confidently use them without concerns about duplication.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I need further assistance or have additional questions?",
    answer:
      "Our support team is always available to assist you with any questions or concerns. Whether you need guidance on design selection, require help with revisions, or have any other queries, we are here to help.
